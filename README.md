Aakash Bhardwaj

Hi, I am a Software Engineer 👨‍💻

🔭 Highlights: Currently I am working as a full-time React/Frontend Developer in Gluelabs. 

🌱 I like to build websites, web applications, and everything in between. 🙂

👯 I love exploring new technologies and frameworks. If you want to discuss something over programming, let's grab a cup of Coffee together.

💬 Ask me about CSS, javascript, react, react-native, nextjs, server-side rendering, redux, react-query, typescript, tailwind, SQL. . .

📫 Let's have a conversation aakashbhardwaj643@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: I like to cook, read books, and try out different stuff from time to time.
